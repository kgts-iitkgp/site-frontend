              <b>The KGPian Game Theory Society</b> was founded on{" "}
              <b>19th August 2010</b> by <b>Manoj Gadia</b>. It is a student
              body which organizes various Game Theory related programs. With a
              motive of spreading awareness, knowledge and application of Game
              Theory, first official session of society was 15th June 2011 to
              14th June 2012. Since then the society has seen tremendous growth
              over the years and witnessed good response from students and game
              theory enthusiasts. By the able guidance and vision of it's
              founder Manoj Gadia, this society has grown to become a family
              with more than 50 members.

              <br /><br />
              The Society was founded with a main motive to promote concepts of{" "}
              <b>Game Theory</b> and <b>Strategic Thinking</b>. Many situations
              in people's lives make them choose between different options and
              we always intend to optimize our chances and get the best outcome.
              This is where Game Theory comes into play. The outcomes decided by
              the situations provoke us to analyze them statistically and hence
              choose the optimal solution through various methods and
              statistics. This society promotes these concepts by various means.

              This project is started under the advice of Prof. Avinash Dixit,
              emeritus professor of Princeton University. Society members
              undergo this self-learning program throughout the year to develop
              their strategic thinking skills. The Society also makes original
              questions based on strategic decision-making to compile it as a
              question bank.<br/>
