                  <b>19th August 2010</b> by <b>Manoj Gadia</b>. It is a student
                  body which organizes various Game Theory related programs.
                  With a motive of spreading awareness, knowledge and
                  application of Game Theory, first official session of society
                  was 15th June 2011 to 14th June 2012. Since then the society
                  has seen tremendous growth over the years and witnessed good
                  response from students and game theory enthusiasts. By the
                  able guidance and vision of it's founder Manoj Gadia, this
                  society has grown to become a family with more than 50
                  members.

                The Society was founded with a main motive to promote concepts
                of <b>Game Theory</b> and <b>Strategic Thinking</b>. Many
                situations in people's lives make them choose between different
                options and we always intend to optimize our chances and get the
                best outcome. This is where Game Theory comes into play. The
                outcomes decided by the situations provoke us to analyze them
                statistically and hence choose the optimal solution through
                various methods and statistics. This society promotes these
                concepts by various means.

                  This project is started under the advice of Prof. Avinash
                  Dixit, emeritus professor of Princeton University. Society
                  members undergo this self-learning program throughout the year
                  to develop their strategic thinking skills. The Society also
                  makes original questions based on strategic decision-making to
                  compile it as a question bank.
